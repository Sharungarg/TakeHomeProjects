# iOS Take Home Projects
This repo is to showcase some of the projects I did as part of the recruitment process at companies.  
A software is never perfect, so if you have any suggestions/corrections for mistakes,  
please feel free to raise of PR, or drop me an email at sharungarg@gmail.com

A big shoutout to the iOS Development Community for teaching awesome stuff, so if you find any similarity in code implementation, 
we both follow the same tutor ðŸ˜‰
